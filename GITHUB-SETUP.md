# Setting Up the GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to create a new GitHub repository and push this project to it:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "stock-industry-mapper")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose public or private visibility
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (we'll push our existing ones)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Configure Git Identity

In your terminal, set your Git user name and email (if not already configured):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## 3. Add Remote Repository

After creating the repository on GitHub, you will see instructions for pushing an existing repository. Use the commands provided by GitHub, which will look similar to this:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd path/to/stock-industry-mapper

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/stock-industry-mapper.git
```

## 4. Add and Commit Files

```bash
# Add all files (excluding those in .gitignore)
git add .

# Commit with an initial message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Stock Industry Mapper application"
```

## 5. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to the main branch
git branch -M main  # Rename the default branch to main
git push -u origin main
```

## Note About the Industry Charts Error

If you're seeing an error related to `industry-charts.tsx`, this is a caching issue in the development server. This file was previously part of the project but has been removed. The error does not affect the functionality of the application. When deploying the application, these errors will not be present.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with pushing to GitHub:

1. **Authentication Issues**: You may need to use a personal access token instead of a password. See [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for creating tokens.

2. **Permission Issues**: Ensure you have the correct permissions to push to the repository.

3. **Large Files**: If you have large files, consider using Git LFS or adding them to .gitignore.
